# Execution ledger

Last updated: 2026-09-08.

## Current checkpoint

- Active task: M2.3, coding edits.
- Completed tasks: M0.1, M0.2, M1.1–M1.4, M2.1 and M2.2.
- M0.3 headless routes are covered; the interactive graphical smoke route remains pending.
- Next action: implement indentation, line transformations and comment toggling as
  selection-preserving single transactions with typed indentation defaults.
- Editor HEAD: `d61c88a`. Haxeon HEAD observed: `4bd73cf`.
- Compiler changes remain separate from editor commits and must pass their own gate.

## Milestones

| Milestone | State | Evidence / remaining gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M0 | In progress | M0.1/M0.2 complete; interactive M0.3 smoke pending |
| M1 | Complete headlessly | Stable pathless identity, atomic persistence, Save As, unified close/quit, external conflicts and bounded recovery pass; graphical prompt smoke remains in the M0.3 manual route |
| M2 | In progress | M2.1 foundations and M2.2 clipboard/navigation pass; coding edits and multiple selections remain |
| M3 | Partial foundation | Command view and split shell exist; navigation, reusable feedback and theme roles remain |
| M4 | Partial foundation | Bounded polling, multi-root search, file operations and sessions exist; scheduling/scale and replacement remain |
| M5 | Partial foundation | Layered typed settings and plugin reload exist; subscriptions and stable editor API remain |
| M6 | Pending | Development workflow |
| M7 | Pending | Packaging, performance and platform checks |

## Completed records

### M0.1 — trustworthy baseline

- Native platform tests, every Haxeon application test entry, and the SDL graphical artifact build successfully.
- `./scripts/test.sh` exited 0; `./scripts/build-sdl.sh` exited 0.
- The pre-existing top-level `README.md` edit remains outside implementation commits.
- A graphical compile does not prove mouse, IME, DPI or screen usability; the interactive M0.3 route remains pending.

### M0.2 — current search slice

- Commit: `35d73f0 Bind document search results to revisions`.
- Matches carry document identity, buffer state and matched text. Selection and replacement reject stale ranges. Editing, undo and active-document changes refresh or invalidate results.
- Replace-all is one buffer edit and therefore one undo operation. Cancelling find clears transient highlights across views. A named command returns workspace search to the project sidebar.
- Coverage reproduces edit-after-find, undo refresh, document switching, replace-all/undo, cancelled highlighting and multi-project result activation.
- `./scripts/test.sh` exited 0 after the final changes.

### M1 — safe file lifecycle

- `b294ba2` added pathless, uniquely identified untitled documents and Save As,
  with duplicate-open and overwrite collision handling.
- `840781f` made backing paths explicitly optional throughout the document and
  versioned recovery models.
- `38328ca` unified tab close, pane close and native quit behind one
  Save/Discard/Cancel coordinator, including shared-document and failed-save cases.
- `91b0234` bounded recovery retention to the newest 50 snapshots and retires an
  accepted snapshot before regenerating state for documents that remain dirty.
- Existing atomic persistence, external-change reconciliation, BOM/newline
  round-trips, missing/corrupt recovery and injected failure cases complete the M1
  headless acceptance routes.
- `./scripts/test.sh` exited 0 at editor HEAD `91b0234`; interactive prompt behavior
  remains part of the pending M0.3 graphical smoke route.

### M2.1 — positions, transactions and view ownership

- `9d5ddf3` replaced the single buffer callback with structured, independently
  releasable change subscriptions and documented UTF-16 code-unit positions at
  Unicode scalar boundaries.
- `942fdbc` began transforming inactive-pane ranges through shared edits.
- `ec158d3` removed caret and selection state from `TextBuffer`; every editor view
  now owns its selection while documents share text and history. View teardown
  releases subscriptions.
- `98a0109` added explicit multi-replacement transactions, adjacent typing groups,
  movement boundaries, redo invalidation and initiating-view selection restoration.
- Tests cover emoji surrogate boundaries, the declared combining-mark behavior,
  independent split-pane cursors, passive range transformation, grouped typing,
  overlapping-transaction rejection and transaction undo/redo.
- `./scripts/test.sh` and `./scripts/build-sdl.sh` both exited 0 at `98a0109`.

### M2.2 — clipboard and navigation

- `a6b5cf8` added platform ABI v5 clipboard read/write with deterministic headless
  storage, SDL integration, HashLink UTF-8 conversion and Ctrl+C/X/V editing.
  Paste normalizes CRLF/CR to the buffer's logical LF representation and remains
  one undo unit.
- `d61c88a` added selection collapse, word/page/document movement and selection,
  double/triple-click selection, SDL click-count forwarding and bounded drag
  autoscroll driven by an injectable clock. Page keys are covered by ABI v6.
- Tests cover multiline/non-ASCII clipboard round-trips, cut/paste undo, viewport
  page movement, word/document ranges, click selection and timed outside-viewport
  dragging.
- `./scripts/test.sh` and `./scripts/build-sdl.sh` both exited 0 at `d61c88a`.

## Previously delivered roadmap foundations

- `028c7fa`: safe file lifecycle, recovery, project polling and restorable split workspaces.
- `21ba9de`: exception-based atomic write integration and embedded-NUL byte test.
- Haxeon `e573f8f`: byte-oriented, error-reporting atomic publication with POSIX durability and Windows replacement support.
- `e9b47c2`: layered configuration and workspace sessions.
- `e08b0e4`: command-view document/workspace search.

These commits satisfy only the behaviors evidenced by their tests; they do not mark an entire later milestone complete.

## Compiler issue register

- Lambda bodies were previously pretyped outside their flow context. Haxeon `0643a3c` removed that unsound pass and added accepted callback/interface cases.
- Atomic publication required a runtime/stdlib facility rather than weakened editor persistence. Haxeon `e573f8f` owns that platform boundary.
- Haxeon `7598300` preserves nullable narrowing for captured locals in callbacks;
  positive and negative regressions pass with the full compiler suite.
- Haxeon `4bd73cf` compares runtime strings by value in statement switches rather
  than relying on pointer identity; its runtime-created-string regression passes.
- Reinspect repository ownership and run the compiler gate before further compiler edits.

## Blockers and pending manual checks

- Interactive M0.3 graphical smoke route is pending.
- Windows atomic publication is implemented but has not been executed on Windows; do not claim platform qualification before M7 evidence.
- No current blocker prevents headless roadmap implementation.
